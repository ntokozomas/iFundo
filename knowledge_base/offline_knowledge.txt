# mitochondria
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. They generate energy by breaking down glucose during cellular respiration.

# nucleus
The nucleus controls the cellâ€™s activities. It stores DNA, the instructions for building proteins.

# chloroplasts
Chloroplasts are found in plant cells. They capture sunlight and turn it into energy through photosynthesis.

# ribosomes
Ribosomes build proteins by assembling amino acids based on instructions from DNA.

# cell membrane
The cell membrane surrounds the cell. It controls what enters and leaves, like a gatekeeper.
